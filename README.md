Description:

This is a small project that I created to dive more into fetching an API. It was awesome creating it, mostly because it was my first time using an API. 

I learned a lot of things during the making of this project. How to secure an API key, fetch an API, and display data from an API. Of course, I exercised some of my previously learned lessons in JS, CSS, and HTML.

Big shout out to [weatherapi.com](https://www.weatherapi.com) for letting me use their API for free.
